* **Supplementary_File_2.xlsx** : representative system details, including RNA-seq and genomic data accession numbers
* **Supplementary_File_3.xlsx** : ranked extremely differentially expressed homeologs in the reversal category, for all systems
* **Supplementary_File_4.xlsx** : ranked extremely differentially expressed homeologs in the inherited DE category, for all systems
* **Supplementary_File_5.xlsx** : ranked extremely differentially expressed homeologs in the bias category, for all systems
* **Supplementary_File_6.xlsx** : enriched GO terms (biological process, cellular component, molecular function) in the blending, bias, reversal, and inherited DE categories, for all systems
* **Supplementary_File_7.xlsx** : hybrid system assignment of all enriched GO terms in the blending, bias, reversal, and inherited DE categories
